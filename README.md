# Alien-Invasion-Tutorial
To complete this I have followed a tutorial in a book called Python crash course by Eric Matthes.

My main objectives for carrying out this personal project were to:
- Learn about object oriented programming
- Learn what a framework was and how to use one
- Learn how a full program comes together, rather than just creating console based output/projects

## Description

An alien invation game built using Python and the Pygame framework.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship 
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys
the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears
that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the
players ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses
a ship. If the player looses three ships, the game ends.
To exit the game press the "Q" key.
